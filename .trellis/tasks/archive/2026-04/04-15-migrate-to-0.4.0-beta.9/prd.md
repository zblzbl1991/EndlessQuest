## v0.4.0-beta.1 Migration Guide

## Command Consolidation

The following commands have been merged:

| Old (removed) | New (replacement) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `before-backend-dev` | `before-dev` |
| `before-frontend-dev` | `before-dev` |
| `check-backend` | `check` |
| `check-frontend` | `check` |

### If you never customized these commands

No action needed. `trellis update` will:
1. Auto-delete the old files (hash-verified, only if unmodified)
2. Write the new unified `before-dev` and `check` commands

### If you customized the old commands

The old files will NOT be deleted (hash mismatch protection). You need to:
1. Open the new `before-dev` / `check` command file
2. Merge your customizations from the old backend/frontend variants into the unified file
3. Delete the old files manually once merged

### Affected paths per platform

- **Claude**: `.claude/commands/trellis/`
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/commands/`
- **iFlow**: `.iflow/commands/trellis/`
- **OpenCode**: `.opencode/commands/trellis/`
- **Gemini**: `.gemini/commands/trellis/`
- **Kilo**: `.kilocode/workflows/`
- **Codex**: `.agents/skills/`
- **Kiro**: `.kiro/skills/`
- **Qoder**: `.qoder/skills/`

## Python Scripts Refactoring

All `.trellis/scripts/` files have been restructured internally. **No action needed** — all entry paths (`python3 .trellis/scripts/task.py`, etc.) remain unchanged. `trellis update` will sync the new scripts automatically.

### AI Assistant Instructions

When helping with this migration:

When helping users migrate to v0.4.0-beta.1:

1. **Check for customized old commands**: Run `git diff` or compare file hashes to see if the user modified before-backend-dev, before-frontend-dev, check-backend, or check-frontend files.
2. **If customized**: Help merge their customizations into the new unified `before-dev` and `check` files. The new files use `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages` to auto-detect which specs to load, replacing the hardcoded backend/frontend split.
3. **If not customized**: Just run `trellis update` — safe-file-delete will handle cleanup automatically.
4. **Python scripts**: No user action needed. The refactoring preserves all entry paths. If the user has custom scripts that import from `.trellis/scripts/common/`, they may need to update imports (e.g., `from common.io import read_json` instead of inline `_read_json_file`).
